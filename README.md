# Dungeon Generator
Randomly generated top-down grid-maps for all your miscellaneous tabletop needs.
This is a continued work in progress, so expect more features with time.

# To Run:
- Make sure python is installed on your computer. To check, open the command line and run the command `python` or `python3`, you should see the following:
- Pull down the repository and navigate to the project
- Run `python main.py` to start up the program
- It will ask you to provide a dimmension (as of now I recommend 15x15 as the minimum size)
- Your dungeon will be available in the `/dungeon` directory
- If you open in excel or libreoffice, you can see the approximate shape of your dungeon.
