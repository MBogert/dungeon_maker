Why does this file exist?
To include initial project structure in the git repo.
It's a small file.
But it's a pretty useful file.
It saves you from having to make some directories.
It saves me from having to add code for your local bootup.
It saves the code from having to append additional logic to its core functionality.
So thank you, .slug_file, for doing the unspoken work.
We love you, .slug_file <3
